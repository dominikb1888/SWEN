### Competitive Programming Deliverables

In each exercise we will attempt a challenging algorithmic problem from the CSES Problemset: https://cses.fi/problemset/

Use this template for Rust Code: https://github.com/dominikb1888/cses_template


## Class Design - Flipped Classroom

The course is taught in a Flipped Classroom style. You are required to prepare coding exercises and will be asked to present them in front of class on a random selection basis.

- 30 min | Review and joint development of selected Homework Exercises
- 60 min | Theoretical input on computational thinking with Algorithms and Data Structures.
- 90 min | Applying theoretical input in a hands-on class project: Building the Game of Clack (https://github.com/dominikb1888/clap).


## Exam (graded)

The Exam will be written and online. It will be a code exercise just like the ones you practice with tests provided.
