# Software Development - Clean Code, Data Structures, and Algorithms

## Readings and Resources:


### Required Reading:

Lecture:
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/th-deggendorf/detail.action?docID=6925615)

Exercise:
- [Programming Rust (First half)](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/th-deggendorf/detail.action?docID=6643397)
- [Algorithms and Data Structures in Rust (Second half)](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-data-structures-and-algorithms-with-rust/9781788995528)
### Additional Resources

- Rust Book, Brown University with great quizzes: https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/
- Rust by Example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html

### Required Preparation before 1st Day of Class

- Walk through the rustlings tutorial: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
- Finish all [Exercises](././rust_assignments.md) for Session 1 in Rust


### Mandatory Exercises:

Prepare the exercises in the following list according to the sessions they are assigned to. Each exercise should take about 30min to complete, if approached right. There are 2 times 42 exercises (what a surprise). The first 42 are to warm up and get comfortable with Rust. The second 42 are a little more complex and require either a clever algorithm or a good design. Make use of any tool at your disposal and do work in groups to reflect upon the different solutions possible:

- [Rust Exercises](././rust_assignments.md)

Credit: The exercises are taken from [Exercism](http://www.exercism.org), you can find many other languages to practice there and a helpful community. You can also find solutions to each exercise. In you own interest, only look at these solutions after spending at least 30min on an honest attempt to each exercise.


## Class Design - Flipped Classroom

The course is taught in a Flipped Classroom style. You are required to prepare coding exercises and will be asked to present them in front of class on a random selection basis.

- 30 min | Review and joint development of selected Homework Exercises
- 60 min | Theoretical input on computational thinking with Algorithms and Data Structures.
- 90 min | Applying theoretical input in a hands-on class project: Building the Game of Clack (https://github.com/dominikb1888/clap).


## Exam (graded)

The Exam will be written and online. It will be a code exercise just like the ones you practice with tests provided.
