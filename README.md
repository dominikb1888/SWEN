# Software Development - Clean Code, Data Structures, and Algorithms

## Readings and Resources:


### Required Reading:

Lecture:
- [Algorithms and Data Structures with Python](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-42209-6)
- [Supplementary Materials](https://kentdlee.github.io/CS2Plus/build/html/index.html)

Exercise:
- [Guide to Competitive Programming](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-61794-2)

Tutorial:
- [Programming Rust](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/th-deggendorf/detail.action?docID=6643397)


### Additional Resources

- Rust Book, Brown University with great quizzes: https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/
- Rust by Example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html
- [Algorithms and Data Structures in Rust (Second half)](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-data-structures-and-algorithms-with-rust/9781788995528)



### Competitive Programming Deliverables

In each exercise we will attempt a challenging algorithmic problem from the CSES Problemset: https://cses.fi/problemset/



## Class Design - Flipped Classroom

The course is taught in a Flipped Classroom style. You are required to prepare coding exercises and will be asked to present them in front of class on a random selection basis.

- 30 min | Review and joint development of selected Homework Exercises
- 60 min | Theoretical input on computational thinking with Algorithms and Data Structures.
- 90 min | Applying theoretical input in a hands-on class project: Building the Game of Clack (https://github.com/dominikb1888/clap).


## Exam (graded)

The Exam will be written and online. It will be a code exercise just like the ones you practice with tests provided.
