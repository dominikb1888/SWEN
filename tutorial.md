## Exercises:

Prepare the exercises in the following list according to the sessions they are assigned to. Each exercise should take about 30min to complete, if approached right. There are 2 times 42 exercises (what a surprise). The first 42 are to warm up and get comfortable with Rust. The second 42 are a little more complex and require either a clever algorithm or a good design. Make use of any tool at your disposal and do work in groups to reflect upon the different solutions possible:

- [Rust Exercises](././rust_assignments.md)

Credit: The exercises are taken from [Exercism](http://www.exercism.org), you can find many other languages to practice there and a helpful community. You can also find solutions to each exercise. In you own interest, only look at these solutions after spending at least 30min on an honest attempt to each exercise.

## Curriculum

### 1. Types: Rust Data Types and Tooling

Learning Goals:
- Understand why are types important for programming in General
- Understand how can types help support efficiency, safety, and security

- Apply Numeric Types, Strings, and Pointers in your programs.
- Apply Tuples, Arrays, Vectors, and Hashmaps in your programs.

1. Exercise Review:

2. Lecture: Why do we need types and what can we do with them?

3. Project: Creating preliminary Data Structure and Logic for our Game of Clack
